Amarok metadata synchronization plugin for beets.

This plugin for beets gets data from an Amarok collection. It uses the
filesystem path of the file to identify the track in Amarok's database. After
we found the track we store rating and score information as well as Amarok's
unique ID for the track to make re-synchronization of the data easier and more
reliable.

Limitations:

Amarok by default stores its collection data in an embedded MySQL database.
For this plugin to work Amarok needs to be configured to store its collection
data in an external MySQL server. Since no foreign processes can connect to an
embedded MySQL server this plugin wouldn't be able to fetch the information
otherwise.
